# Telco_Churn_Analysis
The telco sector is one of the most sensitive ambitions to digital transformation. Despite this,digitization seems to have put this market in difficulty more than the others. The aim of this study is to explorate the data provide by IBM and to predict the churn rate of customers, because it is much 
cheaper to keep existing customers than to acquire new ones.
The following report aims to analyze the results of the telco industry to find the correlation between a number of customer-specific feaures and the level of churn rate. With the use of tree and svm methods we will identify the best model to predict the level of churn rate and the features most correlated with it.
